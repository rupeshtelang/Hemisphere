Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd rupeshtelang/hemisphere\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Design\r\nThe creation includes the automated CSS3 numbering and alternate styling( i.e. Alternate units of the same element will have different styles). Hovering over the `<div>` makes it spin in such a way that is looks like its a hemisphere. Thats the beauty of **CSS3**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe author, Rupesh Telang (@rupeshtelang), is a rising developer with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery. He has done many projects in C, C#, php and java and still crafting many of them.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
